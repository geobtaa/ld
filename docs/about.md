# About GeoBTAA Linked Data

## Project Overview

The GeoBTAA Linked Data repository is part of the Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) geospatial data infrastructure. This project provides standardized linked data assets to support interoperability and data sharing across member institutions.

## Mission

Our mission is to provide high-quality, well-documented linked data resources that enable:

- **Interoperability**: Standardized data models across institutions
- **Discovery**: Enhanced metadata and semantic search capabilities
- **Reusability**: Shared vocabularies and ontologies
- **Sustainability**: Long-term preservation and maintenance of data assets

## Linked Data Principles

This repository follows the [Linked Data principles](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html):

1. **Use URIs as names for things**
2. **Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names**
3. **When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information**
4. **Include links to other URIs so that they can discover more things**

## Standards and Best Practices

We adhere to the following standards and best practices:

- [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) for data serialization
- [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) for core vocabulary
- [Dublin Core](https://dublincore.org/) for metadata
- [GeoSPARQL](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geosparql) for geospatial data
- [W3C PROV](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/) for provenance

## Governance

This project is governed by the BTAA Geospatial Data Working Group, which includes representatives from member institutions.
